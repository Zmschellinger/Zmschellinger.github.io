# SOC Analyst Path on Hack The Box

This is my journey through the HTB SOC analyst path. 

# 1. Incident Handling Process

This section covered the basics of the cyber kill chain as well as the NIST incident handling process.

In 10 modules, Hack The Box does a good job covering the fundamentals of incident response in a way that is understanding to someone with even a low level of cyber security knowledge. Its also worth nothing that HTB lists tools and software that is commonly used as a SOC analyst which is helpful when looking for tools to learn. 

Hack The Box gives you 100 free cubes (their equivalent of in-game money) which covers about 1 module. This is understandable but still sucks when looking for knowledge. 

Overall im impressed by the SOC Analyst Carrer Path, but am disappointed by the pay-to-learn direction hack the box has taken.
