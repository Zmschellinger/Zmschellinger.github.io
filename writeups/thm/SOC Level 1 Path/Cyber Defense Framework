#Cyber Defense Frameworks 
Module 1/8 in the TryHackMe SOC Level 1 Path

In this module, there are 8 sections, the first being the Junior Security Analyst Intro. This is just a simple introduction to what a Junior SOC anayst will do and what qualifications are neccesary. 

The first thing I did was understand the resonsiblites of a Teir 1 SOC Analyst, which include: 
+ monintoring and investingating alerts
+ configure and manage security tools
+ devlop IDS Signatures

The completion of this module included managing an alert for suscipicious activity, reporting the incident to the SOC Team Lead, and finally adding the malicious IP to the blocked IP list.
